Coloresque
==========

color preview for vim.

###Overview

This is merge of [ap vim-css-color](https://github.com/ap/vim-css-color) and [colorizer](https://github.com/lilydjwg/colorizer).
The main goal was to fix cursorline [bug](https://github.com/skammer/vim-css-color/issues/12) and keep named colors(i.e. white, black, aqua). I ended up mixing both plugins plus wrote some stuff, so I decided to leave it as a separate plugin.

###Installation

Via [vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle):

```
Bundle 'https://github.com/gorodinskiy/coloresque.git'
```
